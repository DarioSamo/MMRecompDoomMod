# Majora's Mask Recompiled DOOM Mod

## Disclaimer

This mod was very much made in jest and is mostly just intended as a proof of concept. **Expect plenty of bugs, softlocks and other buggy interactions if you mess around with it**.

## Features

Play DOOM on a desktop PC placed within the game world itself. You can bring up the desktop at any time by pressing `L + R` and put it away with the same combination.

## Installation

- Install the mod in *Zelda 64: Recompiled*.
- Before running the game, **make sure you have a** `DOOM1.wad` **file in the mods folder**.
  - If you don't own DOOM, you can use the shareware version which is freely available online.
- Run the game! Test it out by pressing `L + R` once you have control of Link.
